### Private_to_Public

## Purpose

Most of the work I'm currently doing is on private repositories.  Since GitHub
doesn't track activity on private repos, commits and the like, I wanted to have a
way to track, in some small way, the work that I was doing.  So I modified a
command line app that was part of one of the projects I completed to post an issue
into this repository when I make some contribution to a private repo.

Nothing fancy.  I'll post the file once I finialize the basic functionality and
add some comments.
